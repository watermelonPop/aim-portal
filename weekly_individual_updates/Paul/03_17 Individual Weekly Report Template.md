2. What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?  
   I ran into a lot of problems with the database, especially with routing errors that caused a lot of fake requests (GET req) that were almost impossible to trace the error to. I am now more equipped and knowledgeable regarding these errors, so I will help my team moving forward.  
     
3. What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 

We are slightly behind track, compounded by the fact that we now have to redo the API endpoints to fit the new ORM database.

4. How is your team functioning from your perspective?  
   We are functioning well, we meet outside of class once a week still and communication is overwhelmingly fast and useful\!  
     
5. What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?  
   I developed a lot of new skills regarding debugging database endpoints, as well as new knowledge on using tests with github workflows.  
     
6. Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

	Probably Simone, she helped me out and bailed me out when I accidentally screwed up the main branch of the repository\!
