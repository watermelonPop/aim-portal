Include **screenshots/graphics** to illustrate what you did this past week:

2. What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?  
   I ran into problems with my other classes to be honest. My software engineering group was also really behind on our deliverables so I really had to cram for that. My plan is to set a dedicated time for capstone especially so that I can focus solely on this class instead of trying to bounce between classes and their work.  
     
3. What is the current overall project status from your perspective?   
   Overall, our project is pretty far behind. I think there’s still many views that need to be implemented and additionally we need to make sure that each of these views are accessible to the max so definitely a lot of work left to do.   
     
4. How is your team functioning from your perspective?  
   Our team is functioning alright. Everyone is doing a good job with their parts and some have been going above and beyond. I need to join that group and make sure we can get all views done before the next demo.  
     
5. What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?  
   New skills I’ve learned this week are using the prisma client because I wanted to be able to show the rest of the team how to use this prisma client and docs.  
     
6. Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

This week the most awesome team member is probably Simone just because of how much work she’s put in overall in creating a new user form and outside of that.

What are you going to work on this next week?  
This next week I’m planning on working on the professor view, specifically the dashboard and making a calendar view. Additionally, I hope to finish this before the week ends so I can also pick up another user story and get more work done to make sure we have a finished product before the last demo.
