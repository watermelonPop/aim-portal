2. What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?  
   Spring break was an issue, and I was working all week at my job for spring break so I found basically no time to work. Additionally, in my software engineering class I also had a sprint ending today (3/17) so that’s been more of a priority to work on when I did find time. This week will be a return to normalcy so we can get more done.  
     
3. What is the current overall project status from your perspective?   
   Overall, our project is a little behind. We are planning to migrate to the new ORM database today and I’m making a google doc to give easy explanations for the prisma schema and the frontend will have to work on making sure they adjust their queries and how the data is formatted.   
     
4. How is your team functioning from your perspective?  
   Our team is functioning well so far. We enjoy working together and are able to bounce ideas off each other. Our chemistry continues to improve as we’re all putting in our best foot forward to meet deadlines and finish the sprints.  
     
5. What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?  
   New skills I’ve learned this week would be working with azure and azure blob storage because these are new to me. Additionally, working with multiple databases is new to me and finding a way to integrate the blob storage with our neon database.  
     
6. Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

My most awesome team member this week would be Paul because he helped me out by working on populating the ORM database.
