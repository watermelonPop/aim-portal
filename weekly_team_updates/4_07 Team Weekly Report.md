Full product functionality is available\! All thatâ€™s left to do for the project is some tweaks for css, editing keyboard navigation to be a little less tedious, and confirming screen reader support works as fluidly as possible. Additionally, we will be performing user studies to look at our current deployed product and find what other ways this website could be improved upon.
