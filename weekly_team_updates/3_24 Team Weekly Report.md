| Status Report |
| :---- |

This week, we made strong progress across multiple areas. Completed features include refactored API endpoints, the new student application process, accessibility settings, and both student and user profile views. Azure Blob Storage was successfully integrated with our Neon database, enabling role-based file access in line with HIPAA and FERPA requirements.

On the professor side, the dashboard and class views are in progress. For staff, tech, and test module views are underway, and the staff dashboard has been fully refactored. We've also begun implementing request management for approvals and denials.

Student accommodation displays are complete, with the submission feature currently in development. Overall, we’re closing key gaps across roles and continuing to secure and streamline the user experience.
