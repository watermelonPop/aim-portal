2. **How is the team doing with communication? How will the team adjust going forward?**   
   Amazing\! Our team is constantly communicating and are usually present for all meetings. Going forward we could possibly work on being more open to asking others for help or admitting bottlenecks. 

3. **How is the team doing with time? (Is the project on track, behind schedule, ahead of schedule?) How will the team adjust going forward?**   
     
   We didn’t end up finishing all our sprint 2 tasks, but now that we have a clean base to work off of after the refactor & database setup, we should be able to finish in time.
