| Status Report |

This week, the team continued working on the various skeleton pages for each and added functionalities such as “new student request” and “submit student form.” We also worked on creating staff functionalities such as viewing existing students, being able to edit their information, and viewing student requests. We realized that the old database was not very efficient and that the schema was slightly wrong. In order to solve this problem, we worked on transferring the database to an ORM model.
