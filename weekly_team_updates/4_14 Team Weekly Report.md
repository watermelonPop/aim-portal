| Status Report |
| :---- |

The team was set to meet with the sponsor, Justin, on Monday morning, but he rescheduled it to Tuesday. We continued working on ensuring that each page was screen reader and keyboard navigable and implementing the accessibility setting to each page. Test coverage was a concern that we had, so we also continued improving that and hope to have coverage up to 90% by the expo.
