Our project is in the finalization stage. Our priorities right now are getting as many responses from user stories as possible and also fixing bugs as we find them. At the moment the team is working on our final presentation and poster for the EPS. Additionally, we are working on making a final draft of the Capstone Project Report.

| From Whom | Feedback | Next Steps |
