| Status Report |
| :---- |

Currently our team is working on finishing all main views by Monday or Tuesday to focus more efforts on adding accessibility features and ease of use. Additionally, we plan to add more functionality for current views like being advisors being able to update accommodations statuses and professors being able to approve accommodations, add and delete exams for students and entire courses. We also want to add more tests for more views to get back to the code coverage % for our definition of success.

2. What feedback has the team received?

| From Whom | Feedback | Next Steps |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Justin | Skip to link button more helpful for motor disabilities than for visual disabilities Asking people about needed guidelines for user surveys. | Implementing skip to link with motor disabilities in mind Waiting for an email back about necessary guidelines for user surveys |
| Peerceptive | “Breaking errors” was not very descriptive for what constitutes a failing test | Define what constitutes a “breaking error” in the design document. |
| Peerceptive | We should talk about accessibility features and focus more | Talk more about accessibility standards and requirements regarding WCAG3 and ADA in our design document. |
| Peerceptive | Accessibility testing should also be another form of testing for your group. | We should look at new metrics to test accessibility for our site such as an accessibility checker instead of doing it by ear and by in person checks. More automated tests and qualitative tests. |
| Peerceptive | Functionality tests are vague. We need to be more specific than just “make sure it works”. | Enhance functionality tests |
